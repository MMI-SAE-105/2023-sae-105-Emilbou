        <h2 class="Jugend-title">Explication</h2>
        <p class="Jugend-texte">"Egyptian No. 1" is a book by British design historian Owen Jones, first published in 1856. The book is considered one of the most influential works on the subject of Egyptian design and decoration, and it is widely credited with introducing the British public to the beauty and complexity of ancient Egyptian art and architecture.

            The book is filled with over 700 illustrations, many of which were drawn by Jones himself, and include reproductions of hieroglyphs, sculptures, and other decorative elements from ancient Egyptian temples and tombs. Jones' book provides detailed analysis of the various design motifs used in ancient Egyptian art, such as the lotus flower, the papyrus plant, and the scarab beetle.
            
            In "Egyptian No.1", Jones argues that ancient Egyptian art and architecture was created with a highly sophisticated understanding of design principles and aesthetics. He emphasizes that the intricate geometric patterns, symbolic imagery, and rich colors that are characteristic of ancient Egyptian art, were carefully chosen and executed to convey specific meaning.
            
            The book was very popular and successful when it was first published and it had a significant impact on the Victorian aesthetic. It influenced art and architecture, as well as decorative arts, furniture, and interior design. Jones's work is considered a founding document in the field of design history and has been widely used as a reference by subsequent scholars and designers.
            
            Nowadays, Owen Jones' book still considered as one of the most important primary source for anyone who wants to study ancient Egyptian art, architecture and design. It's also still inspiring to many artists, designers and architects to find new ways to integrate ancient egyptian motifs in contemporary designs.
